## Project Overview

**Logistics Management System** is a centralized web platform for the logistics department, featuring an inventory database, transparent employee workflows, a ticketing system, and equipment location tracking. 

## Goals

To create a comprehensive database that records and tracks all inventory items operated by the logistics department or owned by the company, with detailed information about their status, location, the person responsible for them, etc.

To provide a flexible and transparent system of interaction with all inventory items (import, relocation, export).

To minimise interface development costs.

## Main design process points

### Interviews

I conducted several interviews with the Business Analyst (BA), stakeholders, and head of the logistics department to identify key pain points, essential functionality, and the overall product vision.

### Key pains

* To find the placement of the equipment items that are assigned to the logistics department;
* To find a free place for storing equipment items;
* To monitor all the actions with the equipment by the department staff.

### Information architecture

Based on the results of the interviews with stakeholders and the department head, I developed the information architecture of the logistics management system.

### UI library

The React UI library MUI 4 was used to minimise development costs, and ready-made development solutions were reused between teams for the same purpose.

I designed a UI kit to speed up the design process and maintain the consistency of the project.

### Key solutions

The users' primary pain was finding a location and a free place to store equipment and inventory items. The following solutions show how to cover these needs within the interface.

## Main takeaways

Reduced the time and costs of the development process by addressing complex issues and foreseeing variable scenarios;

Design solutions from this project influenced other company initiatives;

The UI KIT I created was successfully reused in another MUI 4-based project.
